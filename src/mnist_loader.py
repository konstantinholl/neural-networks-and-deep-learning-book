"""
mnist_loader
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A library to load the MNIST image data. For details of the data
structures that are returned, see the doc strings for ``load_data``
and ``load_data_wrapper``. In practice, ``load_data_wrapper`` is the
function usually called by our neural network code.

import gzip

# Third-party libraries
import numpy as np

    the validation data, and the test data.
